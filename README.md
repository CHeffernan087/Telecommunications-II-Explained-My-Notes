# Telecommunications-II Explained: My Notes
A set of key note slides to explain in simple language with nice animations, the networking concepts involved in our Telecommunications II module. Note to gain full advantage of reading slides, it is strongly advised you read in presentation mode as some of the animations which I have used to explain concepts just become obsolete otherwise.
